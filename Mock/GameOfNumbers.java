    /**
     * Mirko and Slavko are playing a game.
     * Mirko’s turn is first and he chooses a non-empty set of pairs of numbers between 1 and N (inclusive)
     * under the condition that the numbers that comprise a pair are mutually relatively prime.
     * The numbers that comprise a pair must be different. For example, for N = 5,
     * Mirko could have chosen the following set of pairs: {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {2, 5}, {3, 5}}.
     * Slavko’s turn is second and his goal is to find a partition for Mirko’s set of pairs.
     * Mirko’s set of pairs has a partition if an integer x from the set {2, 3, ..., N} exists such that,
     * for each pair {a, b}, one of the following holds:
     *
     * • a, b < x
     * • a, b ≥ x
     *
     * For example, a set of pairs {{1, 2}, {3, 4}} has a partition x = 3. If a partition exists,
     * Slavko will surely find it.Mirko wins if Slavko can’t find a partition for his set.
     * Determine how many different sets of pairs exists that Mirko can initially choose and be
     * sure of his victory. Given the fact that the total number of sets can be very large, output
     * the number modulo 1000000000.
     *
     * Input Format:
     *
     * The first line of input contains the integer N.
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * 1 ≤ N ≤ 20
     * Time limit : 1 sec
     *
     * Output Format:
     *
     * The first and only line of output must contain the required number.
     *
     * Sample Input 1:
     *
     * 2
     *
     * Sample Output 1:
     *
     * 1
     *
     * Sample Input 2:
     *
     * 3
     *
     * Sample Output 2:
     *
     * 5
     *
     * Explanation:
     *
     * Clarification of the first example: The only set of pairs that meets the given requirements is {{1, 2}}.
     * Clarification of the second example: An example of a set that meets the given requirements is {{1, 3}, {1, 2}}.
